Query: This is your task: You are playing the board game TicTacToe. Your job is to write the evaluation logic to help an AI play this game. Don't leave parts unfinished or TODOs.
Write it all in a Java class called TicTacToeEvaluator000, with only a single function with this signature:
 - public double evaluateState(core.AbstractGameState gameState, int playerId)
The variable gameState is the current state of the game, and playerId is the ID of the player we evaluate the state for. The return value is an estimate of the value of the state. This must be between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means we have no chance of winning, 0.50 means we have a 50% chance of winning, and 1.0 means we have won the game.
The first thing you'll do is cast the abstract game state variableto the specific one we need: TicTacToeGameState.
 Write the contents of this function, so that we give a higher numeric evaluation to those game states that are beneficial to the player with the received playerId as id. Take into account the whole game state and possible opponent moves. There are 1 other players in the game.This is the description of the board game TicTacToe: ##  Tic-Tac-Toe: Core Game Rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game played on a 3x3 grid.  Two players, typically designated "X" and "O," take turns placing their mark on an empty square. The goal is to be the first to achieve a line of three of your own marks – either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Here's a breakdown of the core gameplay:**

* **The Grid:**  The game is played on a 3x3 grid, often drawn on paper or a whiteboard.
* **Players:**  Two players participate, one playing as "X" and the other as "O."
* **Turns:**  Players alternate turns, placing their mark in an empty square on the grid.
* **Winning Condition:** The first player to achieve a line of three of their own marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
* **Tie Game:** If all squares are filled without a player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

**Simple and Engaging:**  Tic-Tac-Toe is a quick and engaging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's a great way to introduce strategic thinking and develop problem-solving skills. 


Strategy Summary:
Please provide the information about the game so I can summarise the strategy. I need the rules, mechanics, and goals of the game to provide you with a helpful summary. 

You can use the following API to complete the task:
From class games.tictactoe.TicTacToeGameState:
 - double getGameScore(int): This provides the current score in game turns. This will only be relevant for games that have the concept
of victory points, etc.
If a game does not support this directly, then just return 0.0
 - GridBoard getGridBoard()
 - Token getPlayerToken(int)
From class utilities.Vector2D:
 - int getX()
 - int getY()
From class core.components.GridBoard:
 - List getComponents()
 - VisibilityMode getVisibilityMode()
 - Component getElement(int, int)
 - Component getElement(Vector2D)
 - int getWidth()
 - int getHeight()
 - List getEmptyCells(Component)
 - Component[][] getGridValues()
Assume all the other classes are implemented, and do not include a main function. Add all the import statements required.

Model: GEMINI
Query: This is your task: You are playing the board game TicTacToe. Your job is to write the evaluation logic to help an AI play this game. Don't leave parts unfinished or TODOs.
Write it all in a Java class called TicTacToeEvaluator002, with only a single function with this signature:
 - public double evaluateState(core.AbstractGameState gameState, int playerId)
The variable gameState is the current state of the game, and playerId is the ID of the player we evaluate the state for. The return value is an estimate of the value of the state. This must be between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means we have no chance of winning, 0.50 means we have a 50% chance of winning, and 1.0 means we have won the game.
The first thing you'll do is cast the abstract game state variableto the specific one we need: TicTacToeGameState.
 Write the contents of this function, so that we give a higher numeric evaluation to those game states that are beneficial to the player with the received playerId as id. Take into account the whole game state and possible opponent moves. There are 1 other players in the game.This is the description of the board game TicTacToe: ##  Tic-Tac-Toe: Core Game Rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game played on a 3x3 grid.  Two players, typically designated "X" and "O," take turns placing their mark on an empty square. The goal is to be the first to achieve a line of three of your own marks – either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Here's a breakdown of the core gameplay:**

* **The Grid:**  The game is played on a 3x3 grid, often drawn on paper or a whiteboard.
* **Players:**  Two players participate, one playing as "X" and the other as "O."
* **Turns:**  Players alternate turns, placing their mark in an empty square on the grid.
* **Winning Condition:** The first player to achieve a line of three of their own marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
* **Tie Game:** If all squares are filled without a player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

**Simple and Engaging:**  Tic-Tac-Toe is a quick and engaging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's a great way to introduce strategic thinking and develop problem-solving skills. 


Strategy Summary:
Please provide the information about the game so I can summarise the strategy. I need the rules, mechanics, and goals of the game to provide you with a helpful summary. 

You can use the following API to complete the task:
From class games.tictactoe.TicTacToeGameState:
 - double getGameScore(int): This provides the current score in game turns. This will only be relevant for games that have the concept
of victory points, etc.
If a game does not support this directly, then just return 0.0
 - GridBoard getGridBoard()
 - Token getPlayerToken(int)
From class utilities.Vector2D:
 - int getX()
 - int getY()
From class core.components.GridBoard:
 - List getComponents()
 - VisibilityMode getVisibilityMode()
 - Component getElement(int, int)
 - Component getElement(Vector2D)
 - int getWidth()
 - int getHeight()
 - List getEmptyCells(Component)
 - Component[][] getGridValues()
Assume all the other classes are implemented, and do not include a main function. Add all the import statements required.
