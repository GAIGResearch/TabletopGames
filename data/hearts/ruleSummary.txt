   - Hearts: 1 point each.

**Strategies:**

1. **Queen of Spades:**
   - Avoid leading with the queen of spades.
   - Pass low spades to avoid being stuck with high spades alone.

2. **Hearts:**
   - Save high hearts (especially the queen, king, and ace of hearts) for late-game use to prevent opponents from shooting the moon.
   - Try to avoid leading with hearts early in the game.

3. **Trick Avoidance:**
   - Avoid taking tricks with hearts or the queen of spades.
   - If you must take a trick with points, try to take it from an opponent with a higher score.

4. **Shooting the Moon:**
   - Aim to take all hearts and the queen of spades in one hand to score 0 points and pass 26 points to each opponent.
   - Be cautious, as failing to shoot the moon results in a high score.
