**Game Implementation Summary**

**Game Rules:**

1. **Dice Rolling:** Players roll four dice, split into two pairs to determine column movements.
2. **Column Movement:** Each pair dictates movement in one column.
3. **Turn End:** Players can stop rolling and end their turn at any time to secure progress.
4. **Winning Columns:** Players win a column by reaching the top with a marker.
5. **Loss Condition:** Rolling higher numbers after winning a column can cause loss of all placed markers.
6. **Marker Placement:** Markers cannot be placed in already won columns.
7. **Game Win:** The first player to claim any three columns wins.

**Strategy:**

1. **Focus Columns:** Prioritize columns with numbers 6, 7, or 8 due to higher probability.
2. **Avoid Short Columns:** Columns with fewer steps are less advantageous.
3. **Risk Management:** Stop rolling to secure progress and avoid losing all markers in a column.
4. **Marker Interaction:** If a player's marker lands on another's, they must roll again until moving or losing their turn (blowing it).

**Game Variant:**

- **Four Players:** Encourages more risk-taking due to increased competition.

**Developer Notes:**

- Implement dice rolling mechanics with split pair results.
- Include rules for column movement and marker placement.
- Create logic for winning and losing conditions.
- Add a focus on strategy with column prioritization.
- Integrate the interaction rule for markers on the same space.
- Consider enhancing the game with a four-player mode for increased challenge.
