##  Tic-Tac-Toe: Core Game Rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game played on a 3x3 grid.  Two players, typically designated "X" and "O," take turns placing their mark on an empty square. The goal is to be the first to achieve a line of three of your own marks â€“ either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Here's a breakdown of the core gameplay:**
