These files are all for MCTS agents tuned to play the game with a budget of 40ms or so.

They are not tuned over all possible MCTS parameters, but in most cases will play significantly better than the default MCTS agent.

Where a game has noticeably different settings for different player counts or higher budgets, then these are included in the file name.
