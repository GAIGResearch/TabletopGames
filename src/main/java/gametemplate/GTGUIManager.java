/**
 * <p>This class allows the visualisation of the game. The game components (accessible through {@link Game#getGameState()}
 * should be added into {@link javax.swing.JComponent} subclasses (e.g. {@link javax.swing.JLabel},
 * {@link javax.swing.JPanel}, {@link javax.swing.JScrollPane}; or custom subclasses such as those in {@link gui} package).
 * These JComponents should then be added to the <code>`parent`</code> object received in the class constructor.</p>
 *
 * <p>An appropriate layout should be set for the parent GamePanel as well, e.g. {@link javax.swing.BoxLayout} or
 * {@link java.awt.BorderLayout} or {@link java.awt.GridBagLayout}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Check the super class for methods that can be overwritten for a more custom look, or
 * {@link games.terraformingmars.gui.TMGUI} for an advanced game visualisation example.</p>
 *
 * <p>A simple implementation example can be found in {@link games.tictactoe.gui.TicTacToeGUIManager}.</p>
