/**
 * <p>The extended actions framework supports 2 use-cases: <ol>
 *     <li>A sequence of decisions required to complete an action (e.g. play a card in a game area - which card? - which area?).
 *     This avoids very large action spaces in favour of more decisions throughout the game (alternative: all unit actions
 *     with parameters supplied at initialization, all combinations of parameters computed beforehand).</li>
 *     <li>A sequence of actions triggered by specific decisions (e.g. play a card which forces another player to discard a card - other player: which card to discard?)</li>
 * </ol></p>
 * <p>Extended actions should implement the {@link IExtendedSequence} interface and appropriate methods, as detailed below.</p>
 * <p>They should also extend the {@link AbstractAction} class, or any other core actions. As such, all guidelines in {@link GTAction} apply here as well.</p>
