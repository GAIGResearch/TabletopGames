/**
 * <p>Actions are unit things players can do in the game (e.g. play a card, move a pawn, roll dice, attack etc.).</p>
 * <p>Actions in the game can (and should, if applicable) extend one of the other existing actions, in package {@link core.actions}.
 * Or, a game may simply reuse one of the existing core actions.</p>
 * <p>Actions may have parameters, so as not to duplicate actions for the same type of functionality,
 * e.g. playing card of different types (see {@link games.sushigo.actions.ChooseCard} action from SushiGo as an example).
 * Include these parameters in the class constructor.</p>
 * <p>They need to extend at a minimum the {@link AbstractAction} super class and implement the {@link AbstractAction#execute(AbstractGameState)} method.
 * This is where the main functionality of the action should be inserted, which modifies the given game state appropriately (e.g. if the action is to play a card,
 * then the card will be moved from the player's hand to the discard pile, and the card's effect will be applied).</p>
 * <p>They also need to include {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode()} methods.</p>
 * <p>They <b>MUST NOT</b> keep references to game components. Instead, store the {@link Component#getComponentID()}
 * in variables for any components that must be referenced in the action. Then, in the execute() function,
 * use the {@link AbstractGameState#getComponentById(int)} function to retrieve the actual reference to the component,
 * given your componentID.</p>
