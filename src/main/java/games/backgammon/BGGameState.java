public class BGGameState extends AbstractGameState {

//    Backgammon involves moving 15 checkers around a board, aiming to be the first to "bear off" (remove) all your pieces before your opponent. Players move their pieces based on dice rolls, and a key strategy involves hitting opponent's pieces (blots) to send them to the bar, forcing them to re-enter the game.
//    Here's a more detailed breakdown of the rules:
//            1. Setup:
//    Board: The board has 24 triangular points, divided into four quadrants, with the "home" areas for each player on opposite sides.
//            Checkers: Each player starts with 15 checkers, initially placed in a specific configuration on the board.
//            Dice: Two dice are used, and each player has a cup to shake them.
//    Doubling Cube: A doubling cube is used to increase the stakes during the game.
//            2. Game Play:
//    Starting the Game:
//    Players roll one die each to determine who goes first, and the player with the higher roll starts.
//    Moving Checkers:
//    Players move their checkers around the board, in opposite directions, based on the numbers rolled on the two dice.
//    Hitting Checkers:
//    If a checker lands on a point occupied by only one of the opponent's checkers (a "blot"), that checker is hit and sent to the "bar".
//    Re-entering Checkers:
//    Players must re-enter any checkers on the bar before moving other checkers.
//    Bearing Off:
//    Once all checkers are in the home board, players can start "bearing off" (removing) checkers from the board.
//    Winning the Game:
//    The first player to bear off all their checkers wins the game.
//            3. Key Rules:
//    Open Points: A point that is not occupied by two or more of the opponent's checkers.
//    Closed Points: A point occupied by two or more of the opponent's checkers.
//    Doubling: Players can double the stakes at any time before rolling the dice, and the other player must either accept the double or forfeit the game.
//            Redoubles: After a double, the player who accepted the double can offer to redouble the stakes.
//    Moving Checkers: Players must move both numbers rolled, if possible.
//    Cannot Move: If a player cannot play all the numbers rolled, they must play as many as possible, starting with the larger number.
//            Bouncing: If a player cannot move a checker because of the opponent's closed points, they cannot move any other checkers until the opponent's points become open.

    // the first index is the player, the second index is the point on the board
    // the arrays for each player are in reverse order..i.e each is from the perspective of the player
    // with [0] being the first point (on the player's home board) and [23] being the last (24th) point (on the opponent's home board)
    // so a player's home board is [0] through [5]
