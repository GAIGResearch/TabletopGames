/**
 * This is purely for old-style game implementations from before January 2023 that use the now deprecated TurnOrder
 *
 * This has been deprecated because it all too often led to a mixture of logic and state, and ambiguity over where any individual piece
 * of game logic should be implemented.
 * The new standard (See StandardForwardModel) is to have a clean separation of:
 *  - state within something that extends AbstractGameState
 *  - game logic within something that extends AbstractForwardModel (and this has new method hooks to help)
