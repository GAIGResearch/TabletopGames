        // ACTION_CHOSEN is triggered immediately after a decision is made, but before it is implemented.
        //     Hence it contains the Game State used to make the decision - this is important in Expert Iteration for example.
        // ACTION_TAKEN is triggered after a decision is implemented. The state hence contains the results of the action.
        //     This is useful if we want to update a GUI or similar.
