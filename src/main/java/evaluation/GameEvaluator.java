     * @param game The game that will be run for each trial. After each trial it is reset().
     * @param parametersToTune The ITunableParameters object that defines the parameter space we are optimising over.
     *                    This will vary with whatever is being optimised.
     * @param opponents A List of opponents to be played against. In each trial a random set of these opponents will be
     *                  used in addition to the main agent being tested.
     *                  To use the same set of opponents in each game, this should contain N-1 AbstractPlayers, where
     *                  N is the number of players in the game.
     * @param seed      Random seed to use
     * @param avoidOpponentDuplicates If this is true, then each individual in opponents will only be used once per game.
     *                                If this is false, then it is important not to use AbstractPlayers that maintain
     *                                any state, or that make any use of their playerId. (So RandomPlayer is fine.)
